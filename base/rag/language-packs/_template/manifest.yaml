# Synesis Language Pack Template
#
# To add a new language:
# 1. Copy this _template/ directory to language-packs/<language>/
# 2. Edit manifest.yaml with language-specific metadata
# 3. Edit sources.yaml with document URLs and local paths
# 4. Run: ./scripts/load-language-pack.sh <language>
#
# The ingestion pipeline will:
#   - Fetch documents from URLs in sources.yaml
#   - Chunk them using the strategy in manifest.yaml
#   - Embed and store in a Milvus collection named by 'collection'
