# Model-serving only. Use when you need to deploy/update InferenceServices.
# Run separately from dev-services to avoid restarting planner/webui/etc.
#
# Usage (when model config changes):
#   kustomize build overlays/dev-models | oc apply -f -
#
# Expect 20-30 min for GPU models to load. Use dev-services for day-to-day deploys.
